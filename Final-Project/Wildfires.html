  <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>t was the summer of 1988, and Yellowstone National Park was long overdue for a fire. </p>
<div class="firstparagraph">
<p>My great-grandfather built a cabin outside the park 50 years earlier, and that August when my parents drove through Yellowstone, my mother watched the forest she spent her summers in get consumed by flames. The fires burned nearly 794,000 acres, leaving the impression that America's first national park had been destroyed.</p>
</div>

<p>The 1988 fires were something of a legend, so I grew up hearing stories of that apocalyptic scene. Each summer, when we drove through the park, my mother would recount the story. But each year the scene couldn’t quite form in my mind—it was hard to believe that such beauty could rise from the ashes.</p>

  <span class="firstcharacter">T</span>hirty years later, it seems as though the western United States is constantly ablaze. Devastating photos flood the national media each summer, telling stories of destroyed homes, lost lives and scarred landscapes. Already in 2018, over 8.5 million acres have burned. Over the last 40 years of reliable data, the number of acres consumed by flames is on the rise. </p>

<p>But, because wildfires have always been a part of our ecosystems, the frequency of fires remains fairly constant.</p>


<p>Change is important for a healthy forest, and like Yellowstone, many ecosystems are dependent on periodic exposure to fire. Wildfires clear competing vegetation, return essential nutrients to the soil and pave the way for new growth. </p>

<h1><span class="red">Historic</span> Wildfire Management</h1>
<br>

<p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>fter a few devastating fires in the early 1900s, land management systems had a zero-tolerance policy when it came to wildfires. Every flame was snuffed in the first half of the 20th century, halting natural cycles that had regulated forest ecosystems for thousands of years.</p>

<p>In lower-elevation open dry pine forests, fires are supposed to occur every few years. With suppression, these forests became dense trees filled with undergrowth that hadn’t seen fires in years.</p>

<p>This fuel build-up, rising temperatures, and a developing landscape gave way to larger and more intense fires.</p>

<p>In the 60s, an increasing amount of research proved the essential need for wildfires, and a group of ecologists advised the National Park Service to restore the natural balance that once existed in its parks by monitoring naturally-caused wildfires, rather than suppressing them. New policies based on the changing scientific consensus were implemented, and natural fires were monitored, which proved to be effective management in many parks.</p>

<p>But by the time this was understood, many forests, including Yellowstone, were itching for a massive burn.</p>

<p>According to the National Park Service, Yellowstone management watched the first fires in June of 1988, using models that had been constructed from years of data. But the models couldn’t predict how the fires would spread that summer—with a severe drought and fierce, relentless winds. Eventually, Yellowstone was forced to abandon the model’s suggestions and fight the rapidly spreading flames.</p>

<p>The fires were unprecedented and out of control, and when a snowstorm finally hit in September, over one-third of the park had been ravaged.</p>

<p>These mammoth fires in are the new norm in the western United States. Only about 2% of fires cause 98% of acres burned.</p>

<p>Futhermore, humans start the majority of wildfires- 85.9%. The rest are caused by lightning.</p>

<p>Regardless of their cause, new conditions fan the flames and lengthen fire seasons: fires start earlier and continue later in the year. The fire season is 78 days longer than it was in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history, began on Nov. 8 of this year, extremely late in the wildfire season. It ravaged the state, fueled by fierce winds and dry temperatures, killing 88 people and destroying about 19,000 homes. It was unable to be contained until Nov. 25.</p>

<p> President Donald Trump blamed the fires on California's mismanagement of forests. However, California only owns and manages 3% of forests in the state, the federal government owns and manages 57%.</p>

<p>Federal wildfire policies and funds fall under five agencies: The Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

<p>All other wildfires—on state, local, or private lands--are under the jurisdiction of the state.</p>

<p>Volunteer fire departments are the immediate response for the majority of wildfires. "If they are more serious, they ask for state resources. If it’s more serious than that, federal resources are put to use,” Tania Schoennegall, a scientist at the University of Colorado-Boulder explained to me.</p>

<p>In order to create these collaborative relationships, a framework called the incident command system was developed in the late 1970s, allowing agencies to quickly organize and respond to incidents. “Every time a fire occurs you have to quickly do an evaluation and make a decision whether or not to let it burn,” said Dr. David L. Peterson, a research biologist at the University of Washington.</p>

<p>Joe Carlson, a firefighter with the Oregon Department of Forestry, agreed that the system runs incredibly smoothly: “When you show up on a fire, the first thing I do is like, alright, what radio frequencies are we on? Who's in charge? Who's my boss and his boss, and then once you figure that out, you just get plugged in and they give you a little assignment and you go to work."</p>

<p>According to Dr. Peterson, agencies use computer models that are designed to assess risk to natural resources such as trees, water, air quality, animals, infrastructure, and, of course, us. “What happens nowadays,” Peterson says, “because people live everywhere— they let a fire burn less than 5% of the time.”</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this 95% suppression occurs on federal lands. On nonfederal lands, suppression policies are 100% in almost every state, because too many resources are at risk.</p>

<h1>Navigating the <span class="red">Complexities</span> of the Wildland-Urban Interface</h1>

<br>

<p><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>ur landscape is changing as we are suburbanizing forests and wildlands. Construction is increasing in previously undeveloped areas, and whole communities are surrounded by dry fuel build-up. This intersection of human development and natural terrain is called the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) and currently constitutes 10% of the United States, and 33% of all homes.</p>

<p>This is why California's Camp Fire was so deadly, it began in the Wildland-Urban Interface and spread down into more urbanized areas.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/campfiremap.jpg" alt="Camp Fire Map" width=60%;>
<p class="caption">California's Camp Fire started in the WUI and rapidly spread. Credit: Google Maps.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Wildfire policy is becoming increasingly complex as the WUI puts a record amount of property at an extreme risk of being consumed by flames—-about 1.8 million homes.</p>


<p>Other strategies have been employed to try to decrease the amount of build-up before a wildfire hits, like thinning and prescribed burning, but it's more difficult in the WUI.</p>


<p>Wildfire mitigation is happening at both state and federal levels, and it’s effective in lowering the severity of the fire. But the sheer amount of forested land makes it so the chances are slim that the exact treated area will burn. Research done at the University of Colorado-Boulder shows that less than 1% of treated land has ever experienced a wildfire.  </p>

</div>

<div class="explanation">
  <p>The above chart shows the amount of acres that have been treated on federal land by controlled burning (fire), tree thinning (mechanical), and seeding and herbicides (other). It shows the same for land treated in the WUI. </p>
</div>

<br><br>


<p>Dr. Peterson estimates that probably 10-15% of what needs to be done has been done. “Federal and state agencies are already doing what they need to do, but they can’t do it fast enough.”</p>

 <p>“The scale issue is really important, but that gets overlooked by lawmakers,” said Dr. Schoennagel, who was a leading contributor in the research. “Changing the rise in area burn, that’s not going to change by thinning and prescribed burns. "It’s actually really ineffective on a large scale.” </p>

<p>The root of the problem is the rising temperatures, it’s the amount of carbon and methane that we put into the atmosphere. According to research done at the University of Idaho, 50% of the increase in area burned by wildfires in the Western U.S. can be attributed to climate change. </p>

</div>

<br>

<p>“If we want to talk about reversing or even stabilizing the trends, then that [climate change] is where we are going to look.” Schoennagel said. </p>

<p>On our current trajectory, stabilizing the temperature of our planet seems like a long, uphill battle. Which is why Dr. Schoennagel offers a more immediate solution—adapting our communities to the changing climate. </p>

 <p>“But—if we are talking about how we can help humans survive fires more, the solution is how we design, protect, and maintain. There is very little policy on that. All federal policy focuses on trees. We need to focus on adaption.”</p>

<p>This means restricting development in high fire-prone areas, retrofitting old homes and building new ones to withstand ignition, and performing thinning and prescribed burns near communities—something that many people aren’t too keen on.</p>

<p>Firefighters already do controlled burns adjacent to the Urban Interface, as they try to target areas that are at a high risk to burn, but won't be dangerous to those living in the WUI.</p>


<p>Oregon Firefighter Joe Carlson also mentioned that prescribed burning and thinning is not most effective in helping people survive fires: "Do we need more burning, less burning? We need more firewise."</p>

<p>Firewise is a program that teaches people how to landscape around their homes. Carlson says if they see someone with propane tanks, cars and a cedar roof then firefighters can't do anything about it; it's not defensible.</p>

<p>"The loss of property is much more prevalent in California. In Oregon and Washington we didn't lose anything of value this year. We lost some barns, some sheds, some outhouses. We don't lose a lot of stuff up here because we don't have the same amount of people living in the woods and the people that live in the woods in Oregon, they know what they're doing.</p>

<p>"People in California, if we're going to generalize, they live out in the woods, they don't have resources or experiences, there's Santa Ana winds, everything is working against them."</p>

<p>Our fire policies try to make room for the scientific consensus that wildfires are beneficial but as we have hotter, more unpredictable fires and more resources at risk, we funnel more money toward wildfire suppression. </p>

 <p>“By the middle of the 21st century, there will be two or three times more acres burned,” Dr. Peterson says, citing it as a low estimate—some analyses predict a 500% increase. </p>

<p>Yellowstone experienced a rebirth after the fires of 1988, like it was designed to do. The old lodge pole pine forest had survival strategies built into its genetics. However, with the continuing uptick in massive fires, forests are starting to behave differently. </p>

<p>Researchers at Colorado State University found that Rocky Mountain forests have decreasing tree regeneration after a massive fire. Before 2000, 70% of sites that experienced wildfire returned to their same density. More recently, its 46%, and some sites didn’t regenerate at all. </p>

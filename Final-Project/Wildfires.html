<h1>WILDFIRES</h1>

<br>
<p>It was the summer of 2017, and a series of 250 wildfires were sweeping across northern California. Brad Davenport, a firefighter of seven years, stayed behind to fight the rapidly spreading flames while the rest of his family fled to southern California. </p>

<p>The Sonoma Complex fires were driven by the wind, hot and fast, throwing embers hundreds of feet in the air, and causing an incredible amount of damage.</p>

<p>“The fire was three to five miles across the flaming front and coming down a hill towards the towns in the Sonoma Valley. The temperature was probably 125 degrees at times as the wind pushed all the heated air from the fire down on us in the valley floor,” Davenport described.</p>

<blockquote>
        <p>“The ember cast was frighteningly beautiful. We knew what it meant but it was hard not to look up from time to time in awe of what nature can do.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Davenport works for a municipal fire department in California, meaning he spends 95% of the time fighting fires in the city. But with massive wildfires, like the Sonoma Complex, he is called to fight them alongside other agencies, agencies that collaborate in a suprisingly effective way.</p>

<p>Davenport spent 11 days fighting the fire, had one day off, then worked for four more days before returning to his normal schedule.</p>

<p>The fire only got within two miles of his home.</p>

<p>35 lives were lost and 4,500 homes were destroyed, meaning others weren't so lucky.</p>

<h3> - - - - - </h3>

<p>This Sonoma complex fires were not unique to the western United States. Devastating photos flood the national media each summer, telling stories of destroyed homes, lost lives and scarred landscapes. Already in 2018, over 8 million acres have burned. Over the last 40 years of reliable data, the number of acres consumed by flames is on the rise.</p>

<br><br>

<p>But, because wildfires have always been a part of our ecosystems, the frequency of fires remains fairly constant.</p>

<!--graph about frequency of fires-->

<p>Change is important for a healthy forest, so many ecosystems are dependent on periodic exposure to fire. Wildfires clear competing vegetation, return essential nutrients to the soil and pave the way for new growth.</p>

<p>After a few devastating fires in the early 1900s, land management systems had a zero-tolerance policy when it came to wildfires. Every flame was snuffed in the first half of the 20th century, halting natural cycles that had regulated forest ecosystems for thousands of years.</p>

<p>In lower-elevation open dry pine forests, fires are supposed to occur every few years. With suppression, these forests became dense trees filled with undergrowth that hadn’t seen fires in years.</p>

<p>This fuel build-up, rising temperatures, and a developing landscape gave way to larger and more intense fires.</p>

<p>In the 60s, an increasing amount of research proved the essential need for wildfires, and a group of ecologists advised the National Park Service to restore the natural balance that once existed in its parks by monitoring naturally-caused wildfires, rather than suppressing them. New policies based on the changing scientific consensus were implemented, and natural fires were monitored, which proved to be effective management in many parks.</p>

<p>But, by the time this was understood, many forests were itching for a massive burn.</p>

<br> <br>

<p>That was 1988, and the United States spent $578,926,00 to suppress wildfires that year. Last year, we spent over $3 billion.</p>

<p>These mammoth fires in are the new norm in the western United States. Only about 2% of fires cause 98% of acres burned.</p>

<p>Humans start the majority of wildfires, but regardless of their cause, new conditions fan the flames and lengthen fire seasons: fires start earlier and continue later in the year.</p>

<br> <br>

<p>Federal wildfire policies and funds fall under five agencies: The Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

<p>All other wildfires—on state, local, or private lands--are under the jurisdiction of the state.</p>

<p>Volunteer fire departments are the immediate response for the majority of wildfires. "If they are more serious, they ask for state resources. If it’s more serious than that, federal resources are put to use,” Tania Schoennegall, a scientist at the University of Colorado-Boulder explained to me.</p>

<p>In order to create these collaborative relationships, a framework called the incident command system was developed in the late 1970s, allowing agencies to quickly organize and respond to incidents. “Every time a fire occurs you have to quickly do an evaluation and make a decision whether or not to let it burn,” said Dr. David L. Peterson, a research biologist at the University of Washington.</p>

<p>Joe Carlson, a firefighter with the Oregon Department of Forestry, agreed that the system runs incredibly smoothly: “When you show up on a fire, the first thing I do is like, alright, what radio frequencies are we on? Who's in charge? Who's my boss and his boss, and then once you figure that out, you just get plugged in and they give you a little assignment and you go to work."</p>

<p>According to Dr. Peterson, agencies use computer models that are designed to assess risk to natural resources such as trees, water, air quality, animals, infrastructure, and, of course, us. “What happens nowadays,” Peterson says, “because people live everywhere— they let a fire burn less than 5% of the time.”</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this 95% suppression occurs on federal lands. On nonfederal lands, suppression policies are 100% in almost every state, because too many resources are at risk.</p>

<p>Our landscape is changing as we are suburbanizing forests and wildlands. Construction is increasing in previously undeveloped areas, and whole communities are surrounded by dry fuel build-up. This intersection of human development and natural terrain is called the Urban-Wildland Interface (UWI) and currently constitutes 10% of the United States, and 33% of all homes, mostly in the west.</p>

<p>Wildfire policy is becoming increasingly complex as the UWI puts a record amount of property at an extreme risk of being consumed by flames—about 1.8 million homes.</p>

<p>[Data on increasing Urban-Wildlife Interface from the U.S. Forest Service]</p>

<p>Other strategies have been employed to try to decrease the amount of build-up before a wildfire hits, like thinning and prescribed burning.</p>

<p>[data on funds going toward wildfire mitigation]</p>

<p>Wildfire mitigation is happening at both state and federal levels, and it’s effective in lowering the severity of the fire. But the sheer amount of forested land makes it so the chances are slim that the exact treated area will burn. Research done at the University of Colorado-Boulder shows that less than 1% of treated land has ever experienced a wildfire.  </p>

<p> Still, firefighters try to target areas that won't be at risk to humans, but still have a high chance to burn.

<p>[data on prescribed fires from data given to me by Dr. Schoeneggal] [data on treated lands given me by Dr. Schoeneggal]</p>

<p>Dr. Peterson estimates that probably 10-15% of what needs to be done has been done. “Federal and state agencies are already doing what they need to do, but they can’t do it fast enough.”</p>

 <p>“The scale issue is really important, but that gets overlooked by lawmakers,” said Dr. Schoennagel, who was a leading contributor in the research. “Changing the rise in area burn, that’s not going to change by thinning and prescribed burns. <p>It’s actually really ineffective on a large scale.” </p>

<p>The root of the problem is the rising temperatures, it’s the amount of carbon and methane that we put into the atmosphere. According to research done at the University of Idaho, 50% of the increase in area burned by wildfires in the Western U.S. can be attributed to climate change. </p>

<p>[graph of rising temperatures]</p>

<p>“If we want to talk about reversing or even stabilizing the trends, then that [climate change] is where we are going to look.” Schoennagel said. </p>

<p>On our current trajectory, stabilizing the temperature of our planet seems like a long, uphill battle. Which is why Dr. Schoennagel offers a more immediate solution—adapting our communities to the changing climate. </p>

 <p>“But—if we are talking about how we can help humans survive fires more, the solution is how we design, protect, and maintain. There is very little policy on that. All federal policy focuses on trees. We need to focus on adaption.”</p>

<p>This means restricting development in high fire-prone areas, retrofitting old homes and building new ones to withstand ignition, and performing thinning and prescribed burns near communities—something that many people aren’t too keen on.</p>

<p>Our fire policies try to make room for the scientific consensus that wildfires are beneficial but as we have hotter, more unpredictable fires and more resources at risk, we funnel more money toward wildfire suppression. </p>

 <p>“By the middle of the 21st century, there will be two or three times more acres burned,” Dr. Peterson says, citing it as a low estimate—some analyses predict a 500% increase. </p>

<p>Yellowstone experienced a rebirth after the fires of 1988, like it was designed to do. The old lodge pole pine forest had survival strategies built into its genetics. However, with the continuing uptick in massive fires, forests are starting to behave differently. </p>

<p>Researchers at Colorado State University found that Rocky Mountain forests have decreasing tree regeneration after a massive fire. Before 2000, 70% of sites that experienced wildfire returned to their same density. More recently, its 46%, and some sites didn’t regenerate at all. </p>

<p>Dr. Peterson said, “Having large areas of land burning at high intensity—things will change, in terms of dominance of different animals and plant species, where people can recreate, extremes in temperature—but whether that’s good news or bad news? Well that’s based on human values.”</p>
